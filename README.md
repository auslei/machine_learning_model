# Machine learning 

This provides examples of some key statistical models and fundamentals of machine learning. The goal is to document these models and keep it aside for myself to reference back to. Often as we move from project to project, some of the knowledge has been lost, it would be great to summarise what has been learnt and have a reference back later on. Think it more of a back up tape when a computer hard disk is full. :)

Happy for anyone to clone and re-use and do feel free to reach out to me or leave a comment if there are any mistakes. :)


## Linear Regression Model
1.0 - Linear Regression
1.1 - Utilising Gradient Tape method provided by Tensorflow to rewrite linear regression
1.2 - Polynomial requiress (feature treatments)
1.3 - K nearest neighbour

## Logistic Regression Model
2.0 - Logistic Regression

## Decision Trees
3.0 - Decision Trees

## Support Vector Machines
4.0 - SVM

## Dimension Reduction Technics
5.0 - Dimension Reduction

## Emsemble
6.0 - Emsembles


**Recommend**: Create a Python Virual Environment (with Python 3.8+), then install required libraries. 
```
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirement.txt (or install libraries as neeeded, pretty much sklearn)

```

Then it is to find a development environment. A lot of people like Jupyer and a lot like VSCode, depends on personal preference. I'd recommend for documenting nb is a lot easier on the eye.
